cathys-sensor
==

This package contains the C++ code for controlling the sensor suite used by the
autonomous navigation system. Also implemented is a TFT touch screen interface
for displaying real-time sensor data and accepting configuration feedback from
the user at runtime.

Implemented in Arduino 1.8.9 (+Teensyduino 1.47)

TODO
==
  1. Define hardware components used and high-level physical architecture
  2. Define internal and external functional architecture of system components
  3. Define software interface (API) for interacting with sensor suite
  4. Add notes for manual changes made to Teensyduino linker flags
